## Arguments:
## W: Similarity matrix
## group: a numeric vector containing the groups information for each sample in W such as the result of the spectralClustering function. The order should correspond to the sample order in W.
## ColSideColors:  (optional) character vector of length ncol(x) containing the color names for a horizontal side bar that may be used to annotate the columns of x, used by the heatmap function,
## OR a character matrix with number of rows matching number of rows in x.  Each column is plotted as a row similar to heatmap()'s ColSideColors by the heatmap.plus function.
## ... other paramater that can be pass on to the heatmap (if ColSideColor is a NULL or a vector) or  heatmap.plus function (if ColSideColors is matrix)

## Details:
## Using the heatmap or heatmap.plus function to display the similarity matrix
## For representation purpose, the similarity matrix diagonal is set to the median value of W, the matrix is normalised and W = W + t(W) is applied
## In this presentation no clustering method is ran the samples are ordered in function of their group label present in the group arguments.

## Values:
## Plots the similarity matrix using the heatmap function. Samples are ordered by the clusters provided by the argument groups with sample information displayed with a color bar if the ColSideColors argument is informed.

#' ## First, set all the parameters:
#' K = 20;    # number of neighbors, usually (10~30)
#' alpha = 0.5;    # hyperparameter, usually (0.3~0.8)
#' T = 20;   # Number of Iterations, usually (10~20)
#' 
#' ## Data1 is of size n x d_1, 
#' ## where n is the number of patients, d_1 is the number of genes, 
#' ## Data2 is of size n x d_2, 
#' ## where n is the number of patients, d_2 is the number of methylation
#' data(Data1)
#' data(Data2)
#' 
#' ## Here, the simulation data (SNFdata) has two data types. They are complementary to each other. 
#' ## And two data types have the same number of points. 
#' ## The first half data belongs to the first cluster; the rest belongs to the second cluster.
#' truelabel = c(matrix(1,100,1),matrix(2,100,1)); ## the ground truth of the simulated data
#' 
#' ## Calculate distance matrices
#' ## (here we calculate Euclidean Distance, you can use other distance, e.g,correlation)
#' 
#' ## If the data are all continuous values, we recommend the users to perform 
#' ## standard normalization before using SNF, 
#' ## though it is optional depending on the data the users want to use.  
#' # Data1 = standardNormalization(Data1);
#' # Data2 = standardNormalization(Data2);
#' 
#' ## Calculate the pair-wise distance; 
#' ## If the data is continuous, we recommend to use the function "dist2" as follows 
#' Dist1 = dist2(as.matrix(Data1),as.matrix(Data1));
#' Dist2 = dist2(as.matrix(Data2),as.matrix(Data2));
#' 
#' ## next, construct similarity graphs
#' W1 = affinityMatrix(Dist1, K, alpha)
#' W2 = affinityMatrix(Dist2, K, alpha)
#' 
#' ## next, we fuse all the graphs
#' ## then the overall matrix can be computed by similarity network fusion(SNF):
#' W = SNF(list(W1,W2), K, T)
#' 
#' ## With this unified graph W of size n x n, 
#' ## you can do either spectral clustering or Kernel NMF. 
#' ## If you need help with further clustering, please let us know. 
#' 
#' ## You can display clusters in the data by the following function
#' ## where C is the number of clusters.
#' C = 2   							# number of clusters
#' group = spectralClustering(W,C); 	# the final subtypes information
#' 
#' ## Get a matrix containing the group information 
#' ## for the samples such as the SpectralClustering result and the True label
#' M_label=cbind(group,truelabel)
#' colnames(M_label)=c("spectralClustering","TrueLabel")
#' 
#' ## ****
#' ## Comments
#' ## rownames(M_label)=names(spectralClustering) To add if the spectralClustering function 
#' ## pass the sample ID as names.
#' ## or rownames(M_label)=rownames(W) Having W with rownames and colmanes 
#' ## with smaple ID would help as well.
#' ## ***
#' 
#' ## Use the getColorsForGroups function to assign a color to each group
#' ## NB is more than 8 groups, you will have to input a vector 
#' ## of colors into the getColorsForGroups function
#' M_label_colors=t(apply(M_label,1,getColorsForGroups))
#' ## or choose you own colors for each label, for example:
#' M_label_colors=cbind("spectralClustering"=getColorsForGroups(M_label[,"spectralClustering"],
#' colors=c("blue","green")),"TrueLabel"=getColorsForGroups(M_label[,"TrueLabel"],
#' colors=c("orange","cyan")))

#' ## Visualize the clusters present in the given similarity matrix 
#' ## as well as some sample information
#' ## In this presentation no clustering method is ran the samples
